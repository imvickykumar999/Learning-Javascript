JavaScript is a `client-side` script, meaning the browser processes the code instead of the web server. Client-side scripts are commonly used when we want to validate data before sending it to the web server, adjusting the interface in response to user feedback, and for implementing other advanced features.

`Server-side` code can be written in any number of programming languages — examples of popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, and JavaScript (`NodeJS`).

## `Inspect` -> `Console`

```javascript

alert("Hello World");

console.log("Hello World");

document.querySelector(".class-name")

document.getElementById("id-name").click();

```
